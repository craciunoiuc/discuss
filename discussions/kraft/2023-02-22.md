## :dart: Agenda

- 0.4.1 Release
- Round

## :closed_book: Discussions

Release:
 - A summary of https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/releases/tag/v0.4.1

Round:
- CC: Not much from me, I fixed the library ordering problem by pinning libc as the first library, this should fix most of the ordering issues that happen.
- CC: Other than this, I helped AJ with getting some PRs in.
- SJ: Not much from my side. I looked over `kraft setup` on how to do this but still not 100% sure.
- AJ: I reworked the command factory. There are just some wrappers that you need to change and everything pops up.
- AJ: There's a couple of other things: I have partial a fix for the `no-tty` bug. It's probably related to an error that's not propagated properly. If `make` fails, it does not send back an error.
- AJ: Also `kraft run` does not run as expected, which is related to how loggign is done through QEMU.
- AJ: There's a number of things I want to see in the near future: documentation, readme, etc.
- lukas: I was able to use my own fork with kraftkit with v0.4.1.
- lukas: For some reason lwip builds with nolibc so I will se what's happening there.

## :wrench: Decisions and TODOs

- AJ: Add the fixes as PRs once they are ready.
- Lukas: let everyone know if you want to be added to some PRs.
- SJ: Continue investigating the `kraft setup`.
- CC: Sort the issues list and bring them up to date.
