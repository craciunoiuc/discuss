# Unikraft Meetings

This is a repository to store all of the past and future Unikraft community discussions. 

To contribute to this repository, please follow these guidelines:
 * Each meeting will follow the `markdown` format.
 * Each meeting entry will have the name format `yyyy-mm-dd.md` and will be placed in the corresponding meeting and year subfolders.
 * If a meeting is archived, the name of the subfolder should be changed to `name-archived`.
 * If a discussion is not recurring, place it in the `other` subfolder with a suggestive name: `name-yyyy-mm-dd.md`.
 * Only include public meeting discussions.

Each meeting file will follow the structure below.
When creating a new meeting entry, copy this structure and fill in the contents replacing `TO FILL`.
